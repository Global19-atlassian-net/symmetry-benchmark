Name	DHR	Group	Order	H1-Length	L1-Length	H2-Length	L2-Length	Comments
5CWB.A	4	NIH11	8	0	0	0	0	"Clear linear helix. The angle is a bit less than 180	 needing 11 turns to return to the original helix orientation."
5CWC.A	5	R	4	0	0	0	0	"The repeats are linearly translated	 but the two helices in the repeat do not have a consistent orientation with helical symmetry."
5CWD.A	7	S9H2	8	0	0	0	0	"Clear superhelix of 9 repeats per SH turn and 2 alpha-helices per helix turn"
5CWF.A	8	NIH15	8	0	0	0	0	"Clear linear helix	 despite the Baker article. The angle is a bit less than 180	 needing more than 15 turns to return to the original helix orientation."
5CWG.A	10	R	4	0	0	0	0	"Like 5CWC	 the repeats are linearly translated	 but the two helices in the repeat do not have a consistent orientation with helical symmetry."
5CWH.A	14	H2	8	0	0	0	0	"Clear linear helix with perfect rotation angle of 180."
5CWI.A	18	NIH15	8	0	0	0	0	"Clear linear helix. The angle is a bit less than 180	 needing around 15 turns to return to the original helix orientation."
5CWJ.A	49	H2	8	0	0	0	0	"Clear linear helix with nearly perfect rotation angle of 180. A small distortion in the first repeat can be observed	 but it is very small and not observed in the others	 so it might be a terminal distortion and not a symmetry orientation."
5CWK.A	53	S12H2	8	0	0	0	0	Clear superhelix of 12 repeats per SH turn and 2 alpha-helices per helix turn."
5CWL.A	54	NIH30	8	0	0	0	0	"Linear helix. The angle is a bit less than 180	 needing around 30 turns to return to the original helix orientation."
5CWM.A	64	S12H2	8	0	0	0	0	Clear superhelix of 16 repeats per SH turn and 2 alpha-helices per helix turn"
5CWN.A	71	S28H2	8	0	0	0	0	"Clear superhelix of 28 repeats per SH turn and 2 alpha-helices per helix turn."
5CWO.A	76	S14H2	8	0	0	0	0	"Clear superhelix of 14 repeats per SH turn and 2 alpha-helices per helix turn."
5CWP.A	79	S12H2	8	0	0	0	0	"Clear superhelix of 12 repeats per SH turn and 2 alpha-helices per helix turn."
5CWQ.A	81	R	4	0	0	0	0	"Flat toroid	 because the elevation is not sufficient to continue the SH without a clash. Up to 6 two-helical repeats are possible	 so it is an incomplete C6 with 4 repeats. On the other hand	 each helix has consistent orientation	 so if the elevation were sufficient a SH6H2 symmetry could be formed."
